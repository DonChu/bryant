#TODO

- fitvid
- navigation on index isn't switching to fixed
- instagram integration
- photo exif data hover state
- photo permalink / expand buttons on hover
- pagination
- disqus integration
- disqus commment count in footer
- sticky footer?

Looks like a lot of the js stuff is being called in the application.js but there are some reference errors. The fixed nav is working on the individual pages, but not any page with posts.
