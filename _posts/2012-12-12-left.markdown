## Byron

### Byron is a theme for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

Description here.

## Installation

- Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
- Fork this repository
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER/left`
- Run the jekyll server: `jekyll --server`

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.

## Customization

Next you'll want to change a few things. Most of them can be changed directly in
[_config.yml](#). That's where we'll pull your name, Twitter username, and things like that.

There's a few other places that you'll want to change, too:

- [CNAME](#): If you're using
  this on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name, you'll want to change this
  to be the domain you're going to use. All that should be in here is a
  domain name on the first line and nothing else (like: `example.com`).
- [favicon.ico](#): This
  is a smaller version of my gravatar for use as the icon in your browser's
  address bar. You should change it to whatever you'd like.
- [apple-touch-icon.png](#):
  Again, this is my gravatar, and it shows up in iOS and various other apps
  that use this file as an "icon" for your site.

## Deployment

You should deploy with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)- it's just
easier.

All you should have to do is rename your repository on GitHub to be
`username.github.com`. Since everything is on the `gh-pages` branch, you
should be able to see your new site at <http://username.github.com>.

## Licensing

## Thanks

Shout out to [@holman](https://twitter.com/holman) for the great example of how to build a nice jekyll theme like he's done with [Left](https://github.com/holman/left).
