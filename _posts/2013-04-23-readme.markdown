## Introducing Byron

Byron is a theme for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). It is based off of one of our latest [premium themes](byron.stylehatch.co) for tumblr at [Stylehatch](http://stylehatch.co/). We're big fans of Jekyll and the open source community, so we are trying something new.

When we set out to create Byron we had long-form writings, essays and beautiful photography in mind.  Every post type has been thoughtfully crafted to create one Style Hatchâ€™s most versatile premium themes yet. 

## Installation

- Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
- Fork this repository
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER/left`
- Run the jekyll server: `jekyll --server`

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.

## Customization

Next you'll want to change a few things. Most of them can be changed directly in
[_config.yml](#). That's where we'll pull your name, Twitter username, color variables, and things like that.

There's a few other places that you'll want to change, too:

- [CNAME](#): If you're using
  this on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name, you'll want to change this
  to be the domain you're going to use. All that should be in here is a
  domain name on the first line and nothing else (like: `example.com`).
- [favicon.ico](#): This
  is a smaller version of my gravatar for use as the icon in your browser's
  address bar. You should change it to whatever you'd like.
- [apple-touch-icon.png](#):
  Again, this is my gravatar, and it shows up in iOS and various other apps
  that use this file as an "icon" for your site.

## Adding Posts
There are currently 6 supported post types in this theme.

- Text
- Photo
- Quote
- Link
- Audio
- Video

These are defined in the posts YAML front matter such as 
  
    type: text 

These types affect how the post is rendered. Some post types have extra post specific front matter like `photo_url` or `link`. You can see how they work in the example posts for each type.

## Adding Pages
All HTML or Markdown files with YAML front matter will be parsed as individual pages separate from posts. In order to get these to show up in the main navigation they will need the following YAML front matter.

    ---
    layout: page
    title: "title"
    weight: 3
    ---

Weight is used to determine the order within the navigation items (1-10).

## Deployment

You should deploy with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)- it's just
easier.

All you should have to do is rename your repository on GitHub to be
`username.github.com`. Since everything is on the `gh-pages` branch, you
should be able to see your new site at <http://username.github.com>.
