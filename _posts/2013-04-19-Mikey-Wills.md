## Mikey Who?
###I am a purpose driven designer with a passion for products. A realigner not a redesigner. I don't like making things pretty, I like making them better.

I've always thought of myself to have a somewhat conflicted personality. Right brain vs left brain. Artist vs accountant. An artist in the sense that I love ideas and doing things in a new way. I work best on the outer edges; not the status quo. Ideas really inspire and motivate me to do good work. On the other side, an accountant type in the sense that everything has to have a place. There must be purpose behind every product and design decision. You could say, in terms of design, the books have to balance.
